                Open Toolkit, or DITA-OT for short, is a set of Java-based, open source tools that
                provide processing for DITA maps and topic content. You can download the OT and
                install it for free on your computer to get started with topic-based writing and
                publishing. The DITA-OT is licensed under the <xref

            <title>Toolkit documentation</title>
            <p>There are two primary sources for documentation about the toolkit.</p>
            <p>Stable documentation about toolkit usage, parameters, and project management can be
                found on this page, using the navigation panel on the left.</p>
            <p>New information about the latest toolkit builds, plans for the next release, and
                other changing information can be found on the DITA-OT landing page at the
                dita.xml.org site (link below). That site also contains the release notes for all
                upcoming and previous releases</p>
